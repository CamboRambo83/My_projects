The title of this application-layer protocol is "FTP" File transfer protocol.

FTP is pretty much like the HTTP transfers through a web browser. FTP provides a framework to transfer information between two networked computers. The FTP does operates on two different TCP ports: 20 and 21. FTP ports 20 and 21 must both be open on the network for successful file transfers.
